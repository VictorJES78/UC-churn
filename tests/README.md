# TESTS FOLDER

This folder is dedicated to **unit and integration tests**.

* Unit tests aim to test part of your code
* Integration tests aim to test interaction between your code and its
  environment (connection with database, reading/writing in database etc.)

Please see resources [here](https://confluence.par.quinten.io/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=54331151#tab-Robustesse)

**NOTE:** It is recommended to use pytest as testing framework.
